Note: This is a direct response matching the given options since ""Education"" is one of the explicit categories in the list provided, even though it's not listed as an option in the original problem statement. However, if I had to choose strictly from the given options without considering education-related subtopics under other categories (e.g., Economy and Jobs), then this response would fall into the ""Don't Know/Uncertain"" category since education isn't directly listed among the main options."
